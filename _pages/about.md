About me
===

Changrong Xiao is a third-year Ph.D. candidate majoring Information Systems (IS), at the School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University. 

Under the guidance of [Prof. Sean Xin Xu](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1219/7547.htm), my research focus is on the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and education. I am particularly passionate about exploring the transformative potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in aiding second language learners in China. My commitment lies in conducting research that is not only interesting but also bears significant practical implications.
