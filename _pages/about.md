Interests
===
In my daily life, I swim quite often, and I enjoy music and movies. 

My favorite singer is [Faye Wong](https://music.apple.com/cn/artist/%E7%8E%8B%E8%8F%B2/41760704), and I love [Wong Kar Wai](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0939182/)'s movies. 

Hanging out with my friends and teammates is always my first choice of entertainment. No smoking, but alcohol is welcomed :)
