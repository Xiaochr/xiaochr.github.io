About me
===

Changrong Xiao is a third-year Ph.D. candidate majoring Information Systems (IS), at the School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University. 

<!-- He is currently under the supervision of [Prof. Sean Xin Xu](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1219/7547.htm). His research interests lie in Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science. He is now focusing on LLM applications in educational scenarios, working closely with [Prof. Kunpeng Zhang](https://kpzhang.github.io/) and [Prof. Zhitao Yin](https://isom.hkust.edu.hk/faculty-and-staff/directory/zhitaoyin). He also frequently discusses with [Prof. Jiayin Zhang](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1218/7596.htm) on cultural trends and fashion cycles in short video platforms. -->

Under the guidance of [Prof. Sean Xin Xu](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1219/7547.htm), my research focus is on the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and education. I am particularly passionate about exploring the transformative potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in aiding second language learners in China. My commitment lies in conducting research that is not only interesting but also bears significant practical implications.

<!-- Under the guidance of [Prof. Sean Xin Xu](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1219/7547.htm), he is dedicated to "doing interesting and important research". Currently, he is deeply involved in NLP for education, especially the potential of using LLM applications to help second language learners in China.  -->

<!-- in collaboration with [Prof. Kunpeng Zhang](https://kpzhang.github.io/) and [Prof. Zhitao Yin](https://isom.hkust.edu.hk/faculty-and-staff/directory/zhitaoyin).
