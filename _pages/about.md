Interests
===
Xiao is a swim lover, being a member of Tsinghua Waterpolo Team and Swimming Team. 

He is also a great fan of [Faye Wong](https://music.apple.com/cn/artist/%E7%8E%8B%E8%8F%B2/41760704), trying to collect all her CD albums.

His dream is to become a Hobbit in [Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien)'s world of Middle Earth, who is pleased with his little cozy room, but willing to start an adventure at any time. Most importantly, he is justifiable to have 7 meals a day as a Hobbit :)
