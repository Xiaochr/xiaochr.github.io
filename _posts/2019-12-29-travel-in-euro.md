During 2019 fall semester, I studied at the University of Mannheim as an exchange student. I traveled a lot with my friends around Europe then. 

I recorded the wonderful time in an [travel journal](https://xiaochr.github.io/Travel_Journal/). 

Hope the COVID disappear soon! So that we are able to travel freely as before.
